Value error is raised **only after** checking each and every element in the list.

As soon as you encounter an even number stop checking the remaining elements of the list. You can observe that if a 
loop is terminated in advance, then an even number has to be present. So advance termination of loop signals the 
presence of an even number. Also, if an even number is the last element of the list make sure the loop is exited.
